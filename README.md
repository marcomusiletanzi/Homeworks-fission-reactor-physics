These are the final two homework assignments for the course 'Fission Reactor Physics' in the Nuclear Engineering Master of Science program at Politecnico di Milano.
The two projects were carried out with Python.

The first one regards the stability analysis of a Sodium Fast Reactor, performed following these steps:
- study of the linear model
- study of the non-linear model
- implementation of the controller

The second one regards the two-group diffusion numerical solution of a multiplying 1D slab surrounded by an infinite reflector
